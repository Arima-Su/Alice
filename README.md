# Alice-v.3.2
A simple Minecraft server UI to make creating and hosting Minecraft servers less intimidating.
Historically known as the "Server Package", except it's way better.

# Features:
- Built-in version templates for easy creation of new modpack servers.
- Support for discord server status notification. [READ SETUP]
- Support for in-game discord music control. [READ SETUP]

# Setup:
- For all the features to work, you will need to provide a Discord webhook URL in the webhook.txt file included in the .zip file.
- [NOTE] This will only work with [Bocchi The Music Bot](https://github.com/Arima-Su/Bocchi), make sure the webhook is in a channel that Bocchi can access.
