# Alice
A simple Minecraft server UI to make creating and hosting Minecraft servers less intimidating.
Historically known as the "Server Package", except it's way better.

# Warning
As far as I know, the current releases are unstable (as of 08/05/2025, all releases 1.0.5 and below will be deemed broken). Please refrain from using these releases, they will remain only for archival purposes.
New releases will be available soon(tm)

# Features:
- Support for discord server status notification. [READ SETUP] (Currently unavailable)
- Support for in-game discord music control. [READ SETUP] (Currently unavailable)

# Setup:
- For all the features to work, you will need to provide a Discord webhook URL in the webhook.txt file included in the .zip file.
- [NOTE] This will only work with [Bocchi The Music Bot](https://github.com/Arima-Su/Bocchi), make sure the webhook is in a channel that Bocchi can access.
